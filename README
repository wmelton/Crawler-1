PHP script to crawl a specific website, domain or several domains recursively for user specified data.

Currently crawls for e-mail addresses only, but more content types will be added later on.

TODO:
=====
* Respect robots.txt file
* Create a basic frontend for setting crawl location and behavior
* Use frontend to "live broadcast" what's being crawled
